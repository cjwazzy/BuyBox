BuyBox settings may be manipulated in game by using the built in commands as an admin AND an op.  
See "/buybox help" for details.  
CityName is for the name of the city/server that will be buying the items from players and will show up in info menus.  If your city/server has an iconomy account, purchases will also deduct from this account to pay players for their sales.
ItemsPerPlayer is initially set to 0 to disable the BuyBox.  After setting material and price, setting the amount will set ItemsPerPlayer and allow purchases.
